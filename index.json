ConfigureHarpSyncInput sink Operator Configures the ONIX breakout board's Harp sync input. This configuration operator can be linked to a data IO operator, such as HarpSyncInputData, using a shared DeviceName. Harp is a standard for asynchronous real-time data acquisition and experimental control in neuroscience. It includes a clock synchronization protocol which allows Harp devices to be connected to a shared clock line and continuously self-synchronize their clocks to a precision of tens of microseconds. This means that all experimental events are timestamped on the same clock and no post-hoc alignment of timing is necessary. The Harp clock signal is transmitted over a serial line every second. Every time the Harp sync input device in the ONIX breakout board detects a full Harp synchronization packet, a new data frame is emitted pairing the current value of the Harp clock with the local ONIX acquisition clock. Logging the sequence of all Harp synchronization packets can greatly facilitate post-hoc analysis and interpretation of timing signals. For more information see https://harp-tech.org/.

    "keywords": "ContextTask Encapsulates a single ONI context and orchestrates interaction with ONI-compliant hardware. The Open Neuro Interface (ONI) hardware specification and API describe a general purpose acquisition system architecture and programming interface for communication with a host PC. One requirement of ONI is that a host application must hold a \"context\" that contains handles for hardware communication, data acquisition parameters, etc. for a particular hardware controller, such as the ONIX PCIe card. ContextTask fulfills this role for this library. Additionally, once data acquisition is started by the StartAcquisition operator, ContextTask performs the following: It automatically reads and distributes data from hardware using a dedicated acquisition thread. It allows data to be written to devices that accept them. It allows reading from and writing to device registers to control their operation (e.g. Enable or AnalogHighCutoff). Additionally, this operator exposes important information about the underlying ONI hardware such as the device table, clock rates, and block read and write sizes. In summary, ContextTask forms a complete interface for all hardware interaction within the library: all physical interaction with the ONIX system passes through this class. Properties Property Type Description AcquisitionClockHz uint Gets the acquisition clock rate in Hz. This property describes the frequency of ONI controller's acquisition clock, which is used to generate the Clock counter value included in all data frames produced by Data IO operators in this library (e.g. NeuropixelsV1eData or Bno055Data). The value of this property is determined during hardware initialization. BlockReadSize int Gets the number of bytes read per cycle of the ContextTask's acquisition thread. This option allows control over a fundamental trade-off between closed-loop response time and available bandwidth. A minimal value, which is determined by MaxReadFrameSize, will provide the lowest response latency, so long as data can be cleared from hardware memory fast enough to prevent buffering. Larger values will both reduce system call frequency and reduce the number of function calls per unit time performed by Bonsai, and therefore, increase available bandwidth. Larger values may improve processing performance for high-bandwidth data sources. The optimal value depends on the host computer and hardware configuration and must be determined via testing (e.g. using MemoryMonitorData). BlockWriteSize int Gets the number of bytes that are pre-allocated for writing data to hardware. This value determines the amount of memory that is pre-allocated for calls to Write(uint, IntPtr, int), Write<T>(uint, T), and Write<T>(uint, T[]). A larger size will reduce the frequency of dynamic memory allocation system calls but increase the expense of each of those calls. The minimum size of this option is determined by MaxWriteFrameSize. The effect on real-time performance is typically not as large as that of BlockReadSize because this parameter defines a readily-available pool of memory for the creation of output data frames, but does not determine when they are written to hardware. Data is written to hardware as soon as an output frame has been created. In contrast data is read from hardware whenever more than ReadSize bytes have accumulated in the input buffer. DeviceTable Dictionary<uint, Device> Gets the device table containing the device hierarchy of the acquisition system. This dictionary provides access to the ONI Device Table, which maps a set of fully-qualified ONI Device Addresses to a corresponding set of ONI Device Descriptors. The value of this property is determined during hardware initialization. MaxReadFrameSize uint Gets the size of the largest data frame produced by any device with the acquisition system in bytes. This number describes the the size, in bytes, of the largest ONI Data Frame produced by any device within the current device table that generates data. Therefore, it also defines the lower bound for the value of BlockReadSize. The value of this property is determined during hardware initialization. MaxWriteFrameSize uint Gets the size of the largest data frame consumed by any device with the acquisition system in bytes. This number describes the the size, in bytes, of the largest ONI Data Frame consumed by any device within the current device table that accepts data. Therefore, it also defines the lower bound for the value of BlockWriteSize. The value of this property is determined during hardware initialization. SystemClockHz uint Gets the system clock rate in Hz. This property describes the frequency of the clock governing the ONI controller. The value of this property is determined during hardware initialization."

ONIX is built on top of the Open Neuro Interface (ONI) hardware specification and API. One of ONI's requirements is the creation of a \"context\" that holds information needed for communication between a host computer and ONI-compliant hardware. The context holds data such as the device driver that will be used to communicate with hardware, what devices (e.g. headstages and their internal components) are currently connected, how often data should be read by the host computer, etc. CreateContext creates this required ONI context for a single ONIX system. The ONIX system that the context serves is uniquely identified within a host computer by the Driver used to communicate with hardware and the Index, which is a enumeration that is translated by the driver into a physical interface (e.g. a particular PCIe slot) within the host computer. Inputs & Outputs Generates a sequence that creates a new ContextTask object. A sequence containing a single instance of the ContextTask class. Cancelling the sequence will dispose of the created context. Properties Property Type Description Driver string Gets or sets a string specifying the device driver used to communicate with hardware.

For instance, 0 could correspond to a particular PCIe slot or USB port as enumerated by the operating system and translated by an ONI device driver translator.

This configuration operator can be linked to a data IO operator, such as HarpSyncInputData, using a shared DeviceName. Harp is a standard for asynchronous real-time data acquisition and experimental control in neuroscience. It includes a clock synchronization protocol which allows Harp devices to be connected to a shared clock line and continuously self-synchronize their clocks to a precision of tens of microseconds. This means that all experimental events are timestamped on the same clock and no post-hoc alignment of timing is necessary. The Harp clock signal is transmitted over a serial line every second. Every time the Harp sync input device in the ONIX breakout board detects a full Harp synchronization packet, a new data frame is emitted pairing the current value of the Harp clock with the local ONIX acquisition clock. Logging the sequence of all Harp synchronization packets can greatly facilitate post-hoc analysis and interpretation of timing signals. For more information see https://harp-tech.org/. Inputs & Outputs Generates a sequence of HarpSyncInputDataFrames, each of which contains information about a single Harp clock synchronization event. A sequence of HarpSyncInputDataFrames.

    "keywords": "StartAcquisition combinator Operator Starts data acquisition and frame distribution on a ContextTask. The Open Neuro Interface (ONI) hardware specification and API describe a general purpose acquisition system architecture and programming interface for communication with a host PC. One requirement of ONI is a sequence of events that must occur in order to start synchronized data acquisition. StartAcquisition performs these required actions on one or more ContextTasks provided in its input sequence. Once acquisition is started, devices managed by a particular ContextTask will start to produce data in a format called an ONI Data Frame. The output sequence of this operator is therefore a IGroupedObservable<TKey, TElement>, where Tkey Is the address of a particular hardware device within a single ContextTask. TElement Is a ONI Frame produced by the device with address Tkey. These pre-sorted frame sequences can be interpreted by downstream Data I/O operators (e.g. AnalogInput or Bno055Data) that convert ONI Data Frames into data types that are are more amenable to processing within Bonsai workflows. Inputs & Outputs Starts data acquisition and frame distribution on a ContextTask and returns the sequence of all received oni.Frame objects, grouped by device address. The sequence of ContextTask objects on which to start data acquisition and frame distribution. A sequence of data frames produced by each ContextTask in the input sequence and grouped by device address. Properties Property Type Description ReadSize int Gets or sets the number of bytes read per cycle of the ContextTask's acquisition thread. This option allows control over a fundamental trade-off between closed-loop response time and available bandwidth. A minimal value, which is determined by MaxReadFrameSize, will provide the lowest response latency, so long as data can be cleared from hardware memory fast enough to prevent buffering. Larger values will both reduce system call frequency and reduce the number of function calls per unit time performed by Bonsai, and therefore, increase available bandwidth. Larger values may improve processing performance for high-bandwidth data sources. The optimal value depends on the host computer and hardware configuration and must be determined via testing (e.g. using MemoryMonitorData). WriteSize int Gets or sets the number of bytes that are pre-allocated for writing data to hardware. This value determines the amount of memory that is pre-allocated for calls to Write(uint, IntPtr, int), Write<T>(uint, T), and Write<T>(uint, T[]). A larger size will reduce the frequency of dynamic memory allocation system calls but increase the expense of each of those calls. The minimum size of this option is determined by MaxWriteFrameSize. The effect on real-time performance is typically not as large as that of BlockReadSize because this parameter defines a readily-available pool of memory for the creation of output data frames, but does not determine when they are written to hardware. Data is written to hardware as soon as an output frame has been created. In contrast data is read from hardware whenever more than ReadSize bytes have accumulated in the input buffer."

Note that some aspects of Bonsai are only available in specific contexts; for instance, the GUIs mentioned above can only be opened when a workflow is not running. Once a workflow is running, these GUIs are not accessible, but visualizers for certain operators can be opened to view the streaming data. Running a workflow can be done in one of two ways: (1) Press the Start button at the top of the Bonsai editor, and (2) Press F5. Upon starting a workflow, a context will be created, and all devices will be configured based on the Configuration properties. Any *Data operators will then begin streaming data, and can be visualized."

    "keywords": "Tips and Tricks Bonsai Operator Actions When running a workflow in Bonsai, operators are evaluated from left to right, and top to bottom. In a workflow, each node represents an operator defining an sequence of values. Nodes can be connected to other nodes, from left to right. Each connection indicates that the downstream operator on the right subscribes, or \"listens\", to the notifications of the upstream operator on the left. The table below provides some useful information to effectively use the workflow editor. It provides information on how to add connections between operators, remove connections, reordering operators horizontally and vertically, as well as some shortcuts to aid in placing operators more efficiently. Aside from determining the order of execution, the order of operators within a workflow determines which editing actions can be taken. In the table below, the \"first\" operator is always the one that is on the left side, or on the bottom for multiple rows of operators. If the first operator clicked is on the right side, or on the top, these actions will not work. Goal Clicks / Keystrokes Description Connect two operators Click and hold the first operator, drag the cursor to the second operator, and release While dragging the cursor, it will temporarily change to a red symbol until there is a valid target (e.g., the second operator), where it will change to an up arrow Connect two operators Right-click the first operator, and select Create Connection. Select the second operator While moving the cursor, it will change to an up arrow. A valid operator target will change color when hovering over it Connect two operators on placement Click on an operator in the editor to select it, then place an operator using either method (1) or (2) above If an operator is currently selected in the editor when a new operator is added, whether it is added by clicking and dragging, double-clicking, or pressing Enter, the newly placed operator will be connected to the first operator automatically Disconnect two operators Click the first operator to select it, hold Shift, click and hold the first operator, drag to the second operator, and release While dragging the cursor, it will temporarily change to a red symbol until there is a valid target (e.g., the second operator), where it will change to an up arrow Disconnect two operators Right-click the first operator, and select Remove Connection. Select the second operator While moving the cursor, it will change to an up arrow. A valid operator target will change color when hovering over it Move row of operators up Hold Alt, click and hold the first operator, drag upwards to an operator in another row, and release This action does not require that the operator be selected prior to performing the action. The second operator that is highlighted when the button / mouse are released will now be under the first operator Change order of operators in a row Hold Ctrl, click and hold the first operator, drag to the right to the second operator, and release This action does not require that the operator be selected prior to performing the action. This can change the order of any two operators that are a part of the same row; it is not constrained to adjacent operators. Note that if the new placement of the operators is not valid (such as giving a Source operator an input), it will knock the operator of the current row and remove any connections Note In the context of OpenEphys.Onix1, all workflows start with (top line) a CreateContext operator connected to an arbitrary number of Configure* operators, finished with a StartAcquisition operator. Subsequent rows will contain the corresponding *Data operators for capturing data from the hardware has been configured above. Accessing GUIs Some operators, specifically many of the Configure* operators, can have a GUI attached to the operator that allows for easy manipulation of Configuration properties in a graphical environment. These GUIs can be accessed by double-clicking on an operator; if there is a GUI assigned to it, then it will be opened up in a new window. Please note that not all operators have GUIs, but if you think that an operator would benefit from having this functionality added please reach out to us. Note GUIs are not part of the base OpenEphys.Onix1 library. To take advantage of this added functionality, you must install the accompanying OpenEphys.Onix1.Design library using the Bonsai package manager. A number of Bonsai operators also come with GUIs, but similar to OpenEphys.Onix1, the corresponding *.Design library must be installed before it can be leveraged."

    "keywords": "Breakout Board Analog IO The following excerpt from the Breakout Board example workflow demonstrates analog IO functionality by computing a ~1Hz sawtooth pattern, outputting it to the analog IO port, and reading it back from the analog IO port. It also saves analog input data. Analog outputs The RampGenerator operator generates a sequence of single precision floating point values which comprises ~1Hz sawtooth waveform from -10 to 10. The AnalogOutput updates the analog output port upon receiving a value in the upstream sequence. In the Breakout Board example workflow: The AnalogOutput's DeviceName property is set to \"BreakoutBoard/AnalogIO\". This links the AnalogOutput operator to the corresponding configuration operator. The AnalogOutput's DataType property is set to \"Volts\". The RampGenerator operator computes a sawtooth pattern that consists floats in units of volts, so AnalogOutput must be set to \"Volts\" to accept this input. Of course, the RampGenerator could be used to produce a sequence of signed 16-bit DAC codes. In that case, DataType property would be set to \"S16\". Although a voltage ramp is sent to all the channels, only channel 0 was selected to be a output, so this is the only channel that will be affected. If other channels are configured as output (see Breakout Board Configuration), they will also ramp their voltage. The RampGenerator is a GroupWorkflow that contains multiple Bonsai operators. Examine RampGenerator's internals by pressing Ctrl + Enter when the node is selected: Tip To understand how the RampGenerator works, double click each nodes in the workflow while its running to visualize how data is transformed as it flows through each operator. Additionally, the F1 key can be pressed while a node is selected ot bring up its documentation. This video shows how Bonsai how to examine the data flowing through different elements of workflow as it operates. The \"AnalogOutput\" window shows the values that are being used by the AnalogOutput operator to update the analog IO port. 12 signals are produced, one for each channel. However, only analog channel 0 is actually updated because it's the only channel configured as output by the BreakoutBoard operator. The \"AnalogData\" window shows the voltages at the various pins of the analog IO port. They are being read by the the ADCs on the breakout board and produced in Bonsai by the AnalogInput operator. This confirms that only analog channel 0 is outputting the sawtooth waveform. Analog inputs Analog input data is recorded from all analog IO channels, regardless of each channels' AnalogIO setting. Because analog inputs and outputs share pins on the breakout board, this enables a loopback of signals from the analog output through the analog input so that a copy of the output signal being sent to external hardware can be saved automatically. The example workflow does exactly this on analog IO channel 0. The AnalogInput operator receives a sequence of AnalogInputDataFrames. In the Breakout Board example workflow: The AnalogInput's DeviceName is set to \"BreakoutBoard/AnalogIO\". This links the AnalogInput operator to the corresponding configuration operator. The AnalogInput's BufferSize is set to 50. Therefore, each frame will contain a 50-element Clock vector and a 12-channel x 50-sample AnalogData matrix. The analog inputs are sampled at 100 kHz per channel so this corresponds to 500 µs of data. That's lower than the minimal latency introduced by the BlockReadSize setting. Therefore, the chosen value for BufferSize will not impose a significant effect on processing latency. The buffer will be filled essentially every time hardware is accessed and propagated instantly. The AnalogInput's DataType is set to Volts. This means that samples will be represented as units of units of voltage in a single-precision floating point type. The MemberSelector operators each select a member from the AnalogInputDataFrame, Clock and AnalogData which contain the AcquisitionClockHz-based sample times and sample values, respectively. The MatrixWriter operators saves the selected members to files with the following format: analog-clock_<timestamp>.raw and analog-data_<timestamp>.raw, respectively. Tip The easiest way to add a MemberSelector to the output of an operator is to right-click the node and hover over Output in the resulting context menu to examine the output type. A MemberSelector can be added by left-clicking the desired expanded property of the Output type."

Creating an Acquisition Context The CreateContext operator creates a ContextTask that defines the device driver and index where the hardware exists.

Configuring the Breakout Board The ConfigureBreakoutBoard operator groups the properties for all the devices that the breakout board supports. Each device in the property pane can be expanded to expose individual properties that govern their behavior. Tip The Properties section of the ConfigureBreakoutBoard operator provides documentation on the effect of all of the breakout board's configuration settings. To examine and edit the breakout board's properties, click on the Breakout Board node to select it. The properties pane will appear immediately right of the workflow editor. Expanding each of the devices within the properties pane provides access to their configuration settings. The following video demonstrates how properties were edited for the example workflow: This video shows how the breakout board's properties are changed in Bonsai. Specifically, the AnalogIO Direction0 property is set to \"Output\", and the MemoryMonitor Enable property is set to \"True\". It's not necessary to repeat those steps if the workflow is copied/pasted into your editor because they are saved with the workflow. Namely, the following properties were changed form their default values in the breakout board example workflow: The BreakoutBoard's AnalogIO Direction0 property is set to Output. The BreakoutBoard's MemoryMonitor Enable property is set to True. The BreakoutBoard's OutputClock Gate property is set to True. When the workflow is started, the current time (based on Coordinated Universal Time) is saved, along with global hardware parameters governing data acquisition.

At 2.5 MB/s the hardware will produce 2048 bytes every ~800 μs. This is a hard bound on the latency of the system. If lower latencies were required, the hardware would need to produce data more quickly or the ReadSize would need to be reduced. The StartAcquisition's WriteSize property is set to 2048 bytes. This determines the amount of memory that is preallocated for temporarily holding data before it is sent to hardware. It is less critical to performance unless the rate that data be written to the hardware is comparable to the rate that the hardware produces data, which is not a common scenario.

Warning If the hardware FIFO's PercentUsed is non-zero for long time periods, or is increasing, the StartAcquisition's BlockReadSize setting is too small (see the breakout board configuration).

    "keywords": "Headstage64 Memory Monitor The following excerpt from the Breakout Board example workflow demonstrates memory monitor functionality and saves memory monitor data. The MemoryMonitorData operator generates a sequence of MemoryMonitorDataFrames. MemoryMonitorData emits MemoryMonitorDataFrames at a regular interval defined during Breakout Board Configuration using the ConfigureBreakoutBoard's MemoryMonitor SamplesPerSecond property (in our case 10 Hz). In the Breakout Board example workflow, the MemoryMonitorData's DeviceName property is set to \"BreakoutBoard/MemoryMonitor\". This links the MemoryMonitorData operator to the corresponding configuration operator. The CsvWriter operator saves the Clock, BytesUsed, and PercentUsed members to a file with the following format: memory-use_<timestamp>.csv. Because CsvWriter is a sink operator, its output sequence is equivalent to its input sequence. In other words, its output is equivalent to MemoryMonitorData's output. Therefore, it's possible to use a MemberSelector operator on the CsvWriter to select members from the MemoryMonitorDataFrame. The MemberSelector operator selects the PercentUsed member from the MemoryMonitorDataFrame so the user can visualize PercentUsed data from the MemoryMonitorDataFrame. Note The MemoryMonitorDataFrame operator generates a data stream that is most useful in the context of closed-loop performance. It tells the user if data is being consumed rapidly enough by the host PC to keep up with data production by the hardware. The hardware FIFO is a buffer that is required to deal with the fact that computers with normal operating systems cannot perform operations with strict regularity. When there are hiccups in acquisition, the hardware FIFO picks up the slack, but should then be cleared immediately. To get the lowest latencies, the BlockReadSize should be as small as possible while the memory use percentage remains around 0%. Warning If the hardware FIFO's PercentUsed is non-zero for long time periods, or is increasing, the StartAcquisition's BlockReadSize setting is too small (see the breakout board configuration). A small BlockReadSize will mean that the host computer does not have to wait long for enough data to become available to propagate it forward, but will reduce overall bandwidth by increasing the frequency at which the host computer checks if data is available and performs hardware reads."

    "keywords": "NeuropixelsV1e Headstage Configuration The following excerpt from the NeuropixelsV1e Headstage example workflow demonstrates how to create an ONIX acquisition context using CreateContext, configures a NeuropixelsV1e Headstage using ConfigureNeuropixelsV1eHeadstage, and then starts acquisition using StartAcquisition. NOTE To learn more about the top-level configuration motif in every workflow involving ONIX hardware, visit the Configuration Chain Tutorial. Creating an Acquisition Context The CreateContext operator creates a ContextTask that defines the device driver and index where the hardware exists. The Driver property is set to \"riffa\", which is the name of the PCIe device used by ONIX. In this case, the Index property is set to 0 because there is only a single ONIX system. If a second system is used on the same computer, a second CreateContext operator would be required in its own configuration chain, with its Index property set to 1. Configuring the NeuropixelsV1e Headstage The NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage operator is used to configure the Neuropixels V1e Headstage; this can enable streaming of electrophysiology data from a Neuropixels 1.0 probe and orientation data from a Bno055 IMU. This is accomplished in the example workflow by leaving all of the NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage properties set to their default values. Default values for the headstage are: Enabling the first 384 electrodes for streaming (electrodes 0 through 383) This is also known as the Bank A Channel Preset Setting AP Gain to 1000x Setting LFP gain to 50x Enabling the Spike Filter Setting the Reference to External Important The workflow will not run unless gain calibration and ADC calibration files are provided. Click the NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage operator, expand NeuropixelsV1e in the properties pane, then choose the appropriate files by selecting either GainCalibrationFile or AdcCalibrationFile and clicking the ... button. Tip For additional details on how to manually configure the headstage, such as enabling specific electrodes for recording, or modify AP / LFP gain, check out the NeuropixelsV1e GUI page. When the workflow is started, the current time (based on Coordinated Universal Time) is saved, along with global hardware parameters governing data acquisition. This is accomplished using a TimeStamp operator to capture the computer's wall clock time. This Timestamp is saved along with ContextTask's properties (e.g., AcquisitionClockHz, BlockReadSize, BlockWriteSize) to a csv file (start-time_<timestamp>.csv) when the the workflow is started. Starting Acquisition After starting a workflow, the StartAcquisition operator begins data acquisition with the hardware that has been configured. In the NeuropixelsV1e Headstage example workflow, data is collected from the NeuropixelsV1e Headstage only, so the rate of data being produced by the hardware will be ~20.6 MB/s. The StartAcquisition's ReadSize property is set to 4096 bytes, meaning data collection will wait until 4096 bytes of data have been produced by the hardware. At 20.6 MB/s the hardware will produce 4096 bytes every ~200 μs. This is a hard bound on the latency of the system. If lower latencies were required, the hardware would need to produce data more quickly or the ReadSize would need to be reduced. The StartAcquisition's WriteSize property is set to 2048 bytes. This determines the amount of memory that is preallocated for temporarily holding data before it is sent to hardware. It is less critical to performance unless the rate that data be written to the hardware is comparable to the rate that the hardware produces data, which is not a common scenario.

    "title": "NeuropixelsV1e GUI",
    "keywords": "NeuropixelsV1e GUI The NeuropixelsV1e headstage has a graphical user interface when the OpenEphys.Onix1.Design package is downloaded. For more information on how to install that library, check out the Installation page. Overview For NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage, the GUI allows for an easy way to change settings and visualize the effect. From the GUI, you can: Configure the NeuropixelsV1eProbeConfiguration Choose the ADC calibration file Choose the gain calibration file Choose the AP and LFP gain values Enable or disable the AP-band spike filter Change the reference for all electrodes Choose pre-defined channel presets or manually define within a constrained set of possible combinations Easily visualize which electrodes are enabled Configure the Bno055 Enable and disable the PolledBno055Data stream The configuration dialog is accessible by double-clicking on the ConfigureNeuropixelsV1eHeadstage operator. Channel constraints For NeuropixelsV1e, there will always be 384 channels enabled across the entire probe. Therefore, when enabling electrodes (either manually or using channel presets), some previously enabled electrodes will be disabled. Additionally, if more than 384 electrodes are manually selected to be enabled, only the last 384 channels will end up being enabled. It is therefore recommended to always double-check that the correct electrodes are enabled. As an example, let us assume that electrodes 0 through 383 are initially enabled (this corresponds to 384 channels). Then, electrodes 384 and 385 are enabled. When these electrodes are enabled, electrodes 0 and 1 will be disabled. In this way, there will always be 384 channels enabled. In addition to the absolute number of channels, there are other restrictions in place regarding which combinations of electrodes can be enabled at any given time. Specifically, in the NeuropixelsV1eElectrode there is a Channel property which defines the channel index of an electrode. Across the entire probe, no two electrodes that share the same Channel can be simultaneously enabled. Channel presets take this into account automatically and ensure that the rules are followed. When manually enabling electrodes, the indexing logic is applied in the order that electrodes are selected. If two (or more) electrodes are selected that share a Channel value, the highest indexed electrode is the only one that will be enabled. Note Due to these constraints, it is possible that a desired combination of electrodes is not feasible. Keeping or discarding configuration settings While the GUI is open, any changes to the configuration settings can be freely modified and will not affect the configuration unless Okay is pressed. This includes all aspects of the configuration, such as which electrodes are enabled, the chosen reference channel, and the probe calibration file. Note The hardware is not actually configured until the workflow starts. If the window is closed any other way (such as by pressing Cancel, or pressing the X to close the window), then any changes made will not be saved. ProbeInterface The NeuropixelsV1eHeadstage GUI uses ProbeInterface as the format to draw the probes and electrodes visually. For more information on ProbeInterface and the resulting JSON file, check out their format specifications page. When opening the GUI, there is a default probe configuration that is loaded and drawn, which can be saved to a JSON file. Conversely, an existing JSON file can be loaded to update the current channel configuration. If for any reason the default configuration is needed, it can be loaded again at any time. Open Headstage Configuration GUI To open the headstage configuration GUI, double-click the ConfigureNeuropixelsV1eHeadstage operator. Once opened, if the calibration files have not been selected the window should look like the image below. To view the probe, follow the steps below to choose calibration files. Choosing probe calibration files Upon opening the GUI for the first time, if no probe calibration files were set in the Bonsai editor, the window will be mostly blank. To populate the window with a drawing of the probe, both calibration files must be selected. First, click on the ... button to the right of the empty text box under \"ADC Calibration File\" (see below). This will open a file dialog, where the ADC calibration file can be searched for and selected. Once the file is selected, press Open or Enter. This will populate the text box with the filepath to the calibration file. This process is then repeated for the gain calibration file; click on the ... button to the right of the empty text box under Gain Calibration File (see below). This will open a file dialog, where the gain calibration file can be searched for and selected. Note Files are expected to be named XXXXXXXXXXX_ADCCalibration.csv and XXXXXXXXXXX_gainCalValues.csv, where \"XXXXXXXXXXX\" is the probe serial number. Once both files are selected, this will enable visualization of the electrodes. Below is a view of the configuration GUI that has been opened after both calibration files have been selected. Status strip Towards the bottom of the GUI, there is a status strip that reports the serial number found in the selected calibration files. Next to the reported serial numbers is a status symbol indicating if there any potential issues. Below is a list of possible states the status strip will display: Symbol Reason One or no files are selected One or more files are invalid Different serial numbers reported Files are valid, and serial numbers match View ADC correction values Once a valid ADC calibration file has been selected, the View ADC Correction Values button will be enabled. This button can be pressed to open a new dialog that displays the correction values for all ADCs. Refer to NeuropixelsV1eAdc for more details on the specific calibration values. Selecting AP gain The gain for the AP-band can be selected from the dropdown menu next to AP Gain. For a list of possible gain values, check out NeuropixelsV1Gain. If a gain calibration file has been selected and is valid, the gain correction that will be applied is displayed in the textbox underneath the dropdown menu and is updated based on the current gain selected. Selecting LFP gain The gain for the LFP-band can be selected from the dropdown menu next to LFP Gain. For a list of possible gain values, check out NeuropixelsV1Gain. If a gain calibration file has been selected and is valid, the gain correction that will be applied is displayed in the textbox underneath the dropdown menu and is updated based on the current gain selected. Enabling spike filter A checkbox allows enabling or disabling of the spike-band filter. If enabled, the spike-band has a 300 Hz high-pass filter which will be activated. If set to false, the high-pass filter will not to be activated. Selecting channel reference Underneath the probe calibration filepath, there is a dropdown menu for choosing the reference for all channels. For possible values and a brief description of what they correspond to, check out the references page. Channel presets To save time, it is possible to select a preset channel combination from the Channel Presets dropdown. These presets are defined to work within the constraints of NeuropixelsV1e channel combinations defined above. Below is a list of available channel presets: Bank [A | B | C] Enables all electrodes in the chosen bank To learn more about banks, check out NeuropixelsV1Bank. Single Column Enables all even electrodes on Bank A, then all odd electrodes on Bank B Tetrodes Enables the first group of four electrodes for every eight electrodes (electrodes 0-3 but not 4-7) in Bank A, then enables the second group of four for every eight electrodes in Bank B (388-391, but not 384-387). If electrodes are manually enabled, the Channel Presets dropdown will change to None, indicating that a channel preset is no longer selected. Maneuvering along the probe Once a GUI has been opened and a probe calibration file has been selected, the main panel on the left will be populated with a NeuropixelsV1e probe. Below are the buttons used to navigate within this panel to view and choose electrodes. Mouse Controls Mouse wheel zooms in/out towards the cursor Left-click and drag will select electrodes within the drawn rectangle Left-click on an electrode will select that electrode Left-click in empty space will clear the selected electrodes Middle-click and drag will pan the electrodes Scroll bar On the right side of the main panel there is a scroll bar that can be used to move the probe up and down Panning the probe up or down will update the scroll bar once the movement has completed The scroll bar can be moved by: Grabbing the marker using the mouse and dragging it up or down Placing the cursor either above or below the marker and clicking Using the mouse wheel to scroll up or down while the cursor is over the scroll bar Zoom and pan limits When zooming in and out, note that there are limits in both directions. The probe can only be zoomed out to the point that the entire probe is visible within the panel and no more. Similarly, while zooming in the probe will not zoom in past a certain point. In addition to the absolute zoom limits, the panel will automatically shift the probe to ensure it is always in view. This is handled each time the probe is zoomed or panned. To reset the view at any time, click on the Reset Zoom button to fully zoom out the panel. Manually enabling electrodes Electrodes can be selected at any zoom level, but it is often preferable to zoom in to read the electrode indices. Consider maximizing the window to see those numbers more easily. To select, as described above, either click-and-drag the cursor over the desired electrodes, or select individual electrodes by clicking on them one-by-one. Once the electrodes to enable are selected, click on the Enable Selected Electrodes button in the right panel. At this point the selected electrodes should turn blue, indicating that they are now enabled. It is important to note that when electrodes are enabled, a number of previously enabled electrodes will be disabled due to channel constraints. For more information, read the Channel constraints section above. The short video below shows how to select, clear selection, enable selected electrodes, and translate using the scroll bar. Note that once electrodes are manually enabled, the Channel Presets drop-down changes from BankA to None. Then, once the selected electrodes match the preset, it is automatically changed back to BankA. Loading and saving channel configurations When the GUI is first opened and after a probe calibration file has been specified, the default ProbeInterface configuration is loaded and drawn in the main panel. In this case, the default configuration is for a single-shank NeuropixelsV1e probe, with the BankA channel preset selected. To load a new configuration, load the default configuration, or save the current configuration, go to the File drop-down menu (see below) and choose the relevant option. Save ProbeInterface file To save a ProbeInterface JSON file fully describing the probe, including which electrodes are currently enabled, go to the File drop-down menu, and select NeuropixelsV1e → Save Channel Configuration. This will open a file dialog window to save the new JSON file. Choose a folder location and a name for the file, then hit Save. This will export the current channel configuration. This is a useful way to save any manually enabled electrodes as a backup, or to easily switch between different configurations between recordings. Load ProbeInterface file To load a ProbeInterface JSON file, navigate to the File drop-down menu and select NeuropixelsV1e → Load Channel Configuration. This will open a file dialog window; browse to the existing JSON file, select it and press Open to load the channel configuration. The new probe shape will be loaded and drawn, with the enabled electrodes highlighted as usual. Note When loading a new configuration, the total number of electrodes must match the existing configuration, and the number of enabled electrodes must match. Load default configuration To load the default channel configuration at any time, navigate to the File drop-down menu and choose NeuropixelsV1e → Load Default Channel Configuration. This will load the default configuration, with the BankA channel preset selected. Configure Bno055 At the headstage level, there is another device tab listed for a Bno055. From this tab, the device can be enabled or disabled by selecting the appropriate value from the drop-down menu next to Enable. While other properties are displayed here, they have no affect on the underlying device configuration; only changes to the Enable property will be respected."

    "keywords": "NeuropixelsV2e Headstage Configuration The following excerpt from the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow demonstrates how to create an ONIX acquisition context using CreateContext, configures a NeuropixelsV2e Headstage using ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eHeadstage, and then starts acquisition using StartAcquisition. NOTE To learn more about the top-level configuration motif in every workflow involving ONIX hardware, visit the Configuration Chain Tutorial. Creating an Acquisition Context The CreateContext operator creates a ContextTask that defines the device driver and index where the hardware exists. The Driver property is set to \"riffa\", which is the name of the PCIe device used by ONIX. In this case, the Index property is set to 0 because there is only a single ONIX system. If a second system is used on the same computer, a second CreateContext operator would be required in its own configuration chain, with its Index property set to 1. Note The NeuropixelsV2eBeta Headstage functions nearly identically to the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage. Simply replace ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eHeadstage with ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eBetaHeadstage. Configuring the NeuropixelsV2e headstage The NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage operator is set to configure the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage; this can enable streaming of electrophysiology data from a Neuropixels 2.0 probe and orientation data from a Bno055 IMU. This is accomplished in the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow by leaving all of the NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage properties set to their default values. Default values for the headstage are: Enabling the first 384 electrodes of the first shank for streaming (shank 0, electrodes 0 through 383) This is also known as the Shank 0 Bank A Channel Preset Setting the Reference to External Important The workflow will not run unless gain correction files are provided. Click the NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage operator, expand NeuropixelsV2e in the property pane, then choose the appropriate files by selecting either GainCalibrationFileA or GainCalibrationFileB and clicking the ... button. If only one probe is plugged in, only one file is required. Tip For additional details on how to manually configure the headstage, such as enabling specific electrodes for recording, or modify AP / LFP gain, check out the NeuropixelsV2e GUI page. When the workflow is started, the current time (based on Coordinated Universal Time) is saved, along with global hardware parameters governing data acquisition. This is accomplished using a TimeStamp operator to capture the computer's wall clock time. This Timestamp is saved along with ContextTask's properties (e.g., AcquisitionClockHz, BlockReadSize, BlockWriteSize) to a csv file (start-time_<timestamp>.csv) when the the workflow is started. Starting Acquisition After starting a workflow, the StartAcquisition operator begins data acquisition with the hardware that has been configured. In the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow, data is collected from the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage only, so the rate of data being produced by the hardware will be ~18.1 MB/s. The StartAcquisition's ReadSize property is set to 4096 bytes, meaning data collection will wait until 4096 bytes of data have been produced by the hardware. At 18.1 MB/s the hardware will produce 4096 bytes every ~220 μs. This is a hard bound on the latency of the system. If lower latencies were required, the hardware would need to produce data more quickly or the ReadSize would need to be reduced. The StartAcquisition's WriteSize property is set to 2048 bytes. This determines the amount of memory that is preallocated for temporarily holding data before it is sent to hardware. It is less critical to performance unless the rate that data be written to the hardware is comparable to the rate that the hardware produces data, which is not a common scenario. NOTE For an overview of the devices on the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage that can be configured through the ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eHeadstage operator, visit the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage Overview."

    "title": "NeuropixelsV2e GUI",
    "keywords": "NeuropixelsV2e GUI Note The Neuropixels V2e Beta Headstage GUI functions identically to the Neuropixels V2e Headstage. The NeuropixelsV2e headstage has a graphical user interface when the OpenEphys.Onix1.Design package is downloaded. For more information on how to install that library, check out the Installation page. Overview For NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage, the GUI allows for an easy way to change settings and visualize the effect. From the GUI, you can: Configure Probe A and Probe B independently Choose the probe calibration file Change the reference for all electrodes Choose pre-defined channel presets or manually define within a constrained set of possible combinations Easily visualize which electrodes are enabled Enable and disable the Bno055 stream There are two ways to access configuration dialogs; 1) at the individual NeuropixelsV2eProbeConfiguration level where either Probe A or Probe B can be modified by itself, and 2) at the headstage level where both probes can be modified, as well as the NeuropixelsV2eBno055 device. Whether the GUI is opened at the probe configuration level, or the headstage level, the usage will be almost identical. There are some additional tabs present at the headstage level, but the Probe A and Probe B tabs will act exactly the same as opening a probe configuration GUI for that specific probe. Channel constraints For NeuropixelsV2e, there will always be 384 channels enabled across the entire probe. Therefore, when enabling electrodes (either manually or using channel presets), some previously enabled electrodes will be disabled. Additionally, if more than 384 electrodes are manually selected to be enabled, only the last 384 channels will end up being enabled. It is therefore recommended to always double-check that the correct electrodes are enabled. As an example, let us assume that electrodes 0 through 383 are initially enabled (this corresponds to 384 channels). Then, electrodes 384 and 385 are enabled. When these electrodes are enabled, electrodes 0 and 1 will be disabled. In this way, there will always be 384 channels enabled. In addition to the absolute number of channels, there are other restrictions in place regarding which combinations of electrodes can be enabled at any given time. Specifically, in the NeuropixelsV2QuadShankElectrode there is a Channel property which defines the channel index of an electrode. Across the entire probe, no two electrodes that share the same Channel can be simultaneously enabled. Channel presets take this into account automatically and ensure that the rules are followed. When manually enabling electrodes, the indexing logic is applied in the order that electrodes are selected. If two (or more) electrodes are selected that share a Channel value, the highest indexed electrode is the only one that will be enabled. Note Due to these constraints, it is possible that a desired combination of electrodes is not feasible. Keeping or discarding configuration settings While the GUI is open, any changes to the configuration settings can be freely modified and will not affect the configuration unless Okay is pressed. This includes all aspects of the configuration, such as which electrodes are enabled, the chosen reference channel, and the probe calibration file. Note The hardware is not actually configured until the workflow starts. If the window is closed any other way (such as by pressing Cancel, or pressing the X to close the window), then any changes made will not be saved. ProbeInterface The NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage GUI uses ProbeInterface as the format to draw the probes and electrodes visually. For more information on ProbeInterface and the resulting JSON file, check out their format specifications page. When opening the GUI, there is a default probe configuration that is loaded and drawn, which can be saved to a JSON file. Conversely, an existing JSON file can be loaded to update the current channel configuration. If for any reason the default configuration is needed, it can be loaded again at any time. Open Probe Configuration GUI Steps to open the Probe Configuration GUI: Select the ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eHeadstage node. Click on the NeuropixelsV2eProbeConfiguration to edit (either ProbeConfigurationA or ProbeConfigurationB). Select the ... button on the right-most part of the property pane (#1 above). Once opened, if no probe calibration file has been selected the window should look like the image below. To view the probe, follow the steps below. Tip The controls shown for this GUI are the same as the ones shown for the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage Configuration below. Choosing a probe calibration file Upon opening the GUI for the first time, if no probe calibration file was set in the Bonsai editor, the window will be mostly blank. To populate the window with a drawing of the probe, click on the ellipsis button to the right of the empty text box under \"Probe Calibration File:\" (see below). This will open a file dialog, where the calibration file can be searched for and selected. Note Files are expected to be named XXXXXXXXXXX_gainCalValues.csv, where \"XXXXXXXXXXX\" is the probe serial number. Once the file is selected, press Open or Enter. This will populate the text box with the filepath to the calibration file and enable visualization of the electrodes. Below is a view of the Probe Configuration GUI that has been opened for Probe A with a gain calibration file selected. Note that the Gain Correction textbox and the Gain Calibration SN: status strip are automatically filled in with values found in the calibration file. Selecting channel reference Underneath the probe calibration filepath, there is a dropdown menu for choosing the reference for all channels. For possible values and a brief description of what they correspond to, check out the references page. Channel presets To save time, it is possible to select a preset channel combination from the Channel Presets dropdown. These presets are defined to work within the constraints of NeuropixelsV2e channel combinations defined above. Channel presets follow one of these patterns: Shank N Bank [A | B | C | D] Enables all electrodes in the chosen bank on shank N To learn more about the banks along each shank, check out the NeuropixelsV2QuadShankBank page. All Shanks N_M Enables all electrodes starting at shank index N up to shank index M across all four shanks If electrodes are manually enabled, the Channel Presets dropdown will change to None, indicating that a channel preset is no longer selected. Maneuvering along the probe Once a GUI has been opened and a probe calibration file has been selected, the main panel on the left will be populated with a NeuropixelsV2e probe. Below are the buttons used to navigate within this panel to view and choose electrodes. Mouse Controls Mouse wheel zooms in/out towards the cursor Left-click and drag will select electrodes within the drawn rectangle Left-click on an electrode will select that electrode Left-click in empty space will clear the selected electrodes Middle-click and drag will pan the electrodes Scroll bar On the right side of the main panel there is a scroll bar that can be used to move the probe up and down Panning the probe up or down will update the scroll bar once the movement has completed The scroll bar can be moved by: Grabbing the marker using the mouse and dragging it up or down Placing the cursor either above or below the marker and clicking Using the mouse wheel to scroll up or down while the cursor is over the scroll bar Zoom and pan limits When zooming in and out, note that there are limits in both directions. The probe can only be zoomed out to the point that the entire probe is visible within the panel and no more. Similarly, while zooming in the probe will not zoom in past a certain point. In addition to the absolute zoom limits, the panel will automatically shift the probe to ensure it is always in view. This is handled each time the probe is zoomed or panned. To reset the view at any time, click on the Reset Zoom button to fully zoom out the panel. Manually enabling electrodes Electrodes can be selected at any zoom level, but it is often preferable to zoom in to read the electrode indices. Consider maximizing the screen to see those numbers more easily. To select, as described above, either click-and-drag the cursor over the desired electrodes, or select individual electrodes by clicking on them one-by-one. Once the electrodes to enable are selected, click on the Enable Selected Electrodes button in the right panel. At this point the selected electrodes should turn blue, indicating that they are now enabled. It is important to note that when electrodes are enabled, a number of previously enabled electrodes will be disabled due to channel constraints. For more information, read the Channel constraints section above. The short video below shows how to select, clear selection, enable selected electrodes, and translate using the scroll bar. Note that once electrodes are manually enabled, the Channel Presets drop-down changes from Shank0BankA to None. Then, once the selected electrodes match the preset, it is automatically changed back to Shank0BankA. Loading and saving channel configurations When the GUI is first opened and after a probe calibration file has been specified, the default ProbeInterface configuration is loaded and drawn in the main panel. In this case, the default configuration is for a quad-shank NeuropixelsV2e probe, with the Shank0BankA channel preset selected. To load a new configuration, load the default configuration, or save the current configuration, go to the File drop-down menu (see below) and choose the relevant option. Save ProbeInterface file To save a ProbeInterface JSON file fully describing the probe, including which electrodes are currently enabled, go to the File drop-down menu, and select Save Channel Configuration. This will open a file dialog window to save the new JSON file. Choose a folder location and a name for the file, then hit Save. This will export the current channel configuration. This is a useful way to save any manually enabled electrodes as a backup, or to easily switch between different configurations between recordings. Load ProbeInterface file To load a ProbeInterface JSON file, navigate to the File drop-down menu and select Load Channel Configuration. This will open a file dialog window; browse to the existing JSON file, select it and press Open to load the channel configuration. The new probe shape will be loaded and drawn, with the enabled electrodes highlighted as usual. Note When loading a new configuration, the total number of electrodes must match the existing configuration, and the number of enabled electrodes must match. Load default configuration To load the default channel configuration at any time, navigate to the File drop-down menu and choose Load Default Channel Configuration. This will load the default configuration, with the Shank0BankA channel preset selected. Open Headstage Configuration GUI Step to open the headstage configuration GUI Double-click the ConfigureNeuropixelsV2eHeadstage node (#2 above) Once opened, if no probe calibration is selected for either Probe A or Probe B, then both tabs will only show their controls on the right and no probes (see below). Configure Probe A Using the headstage configuration GUI is exactly the same as using the probe configuration GUI. After the GUI has been opened and a probe calibration file has been selected, Probe A will be drawn in the corresponding tab (see below). Configure Probe B Using the headstage configuration GUI is exactly the same as using the probe configuration GUI. After the GUI has been opened and a probe calibration file has been selected, Probe B will be drawn in the corresponding tab (see below). Configure Bno055 At the headstage level, there is another device tab listed for a Bno055. From this tab, the device can be enabled or disabled by selecting the appropriate value from the drop-down menu next to Enable. While the DeviceAddress and DeviceName values are modifiable here, they have no affect on the underlying device configuration; only changes to the Enable property will be respected."

The NeuropixelsV2eData operator generates a sequence of NeuropixelsV2eDataFrames. In the NeuropixelsV2e Headstage example workflow, BufferSize is set to 30. Therefore, each frame will contain a [1 x 30 sample] Clock vector and a [384 channel x 30 sample] AmplifierData matrix. The Neuropixels 2.0 probe samples at 30 kHz per channel so this corresponds to 1 ms of data. DeviceName property is set to \"NeuropixelsV2eHeadstage/NeuropixelsV2e\". This links the NeuropixelsV2eData operator to the corresponding configuration operator. ProbeIndex property is set to \"ProbeA\".

It provides: Support for a variety of tools such as Neuropixels (all variants), Miniscopes, Intan-based headstages, and more Automatic hardware synchronization of all data streams.

Detailed information on library components. How to make the most of ONIX in Bonsai. Go to the hardware documentation site. Why Bonsai? ONIX is built on the ONI standard, which is software agnostic. Bonsai is the first software target pursued by the Open Ephys team for ONIX hardware. There are three major reasons for this: Performance. ONIX is a universal interface for neural recording instruments. It can capture data produced by neural probes, cameras, high-speed ADCs, etc. In general terms, ONIX can capture data from arbitrary mixtures of asynchronous1 data sources. Bonsai provides an extremely powerful, open-source software platform for elegantly collecting, combining, and processing data from essentially any data source regardless of its sample rate, sample regularity, packet size, and bandwidth. Bonsai accomplishes this task in a fundamental manner: it explicitly models each data source as an ordered temporal sequence with a start and end called an Observable. This is analogous to how, for instance, Numpy explicitly models fixed-size multi-dimensional arrays as ndarrays. And, just like Numpy offers an extensive linear algebra toolkit to operate on these arrays, Bonsai offers an analogous toolkit for operating on temporal sequences of data. Because Bonsai was created around this core data model and operator library, it makes capturing, processing, and combining data sequences from different hardware sources natural in Bonsai, whereas it is bug prone and difficult in other software options. Code quality. Open Ephys has been developing open source hardware and software for the Neuroscience community for over a decade. In terms of code quality, Bonsai is excellent. Bonsai uses a modern language and build system, has integrated package management, and an extremely clean, featureful, and well maintained API. Given that Bonsai's development model perfectly aligns with our values, we are very proud to be able to contribute to its growth in the Neuroscience community. Third party integration. Bonsai provides support for hundreds of pieces of open- and closed-source hardware and software that are used extensively in neuroscience research. For instance: The classic Open Ephys acquisition system Ucla Miniscope ecosystem National Instruments acquisition boards Virtually every machine-vision and sCMOS camera2 Sanworks Bpod Harp Deeplabcut & Sleap And much more By targeting Bonsai, ONIX can be used seamlessly with these third party tools. Note We put a lot of effort into making these docs useful for everyone. If you have suggestions for making them even better, please contribute by either raising an issue or following the links saying Edit this page. We welcome all constructive feedback. As always, our goals are better performing tools, less redundant development, and more reproducible science. In addition to this library, we are currently developing ONIX support for the Open Ephys GUI. Although physical data sources are asynchronous (e.g. a Neuropixels probe runs on a distinct clock and produces data at a distinct rate compared to the camera sensor on a Miniscope), all data is hardware-timestamped on a common clock. No post-hoc data alignment is required.↩ Flir, Allied Vision, Ximea, Basler, Excelitas, etc.↩"
