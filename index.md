title: OpenEphys.Onix1
---

`OpenEphys.Onix1` is a [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) library that can be used to control the [ONIX PCIe Acquisition System](https://open-ephys.org/onix/oeps-9006), which provides:

* Support for a variety of tools such as [Neuropixels (all
  variants)](https://www.neuropixels.org/),
  [Miniscopes](https://open-ephys.org/miniscope-v4/miniscope-v4), [Intan-based
  headstages](https://open-ephys.org/onix/oeps-7741), and more
* Automatic hardware synchronization of all data streams.
* Torque-free commutation of ultra-thin (down to ~0.2mm diameter) tethers
* High performance closed-loop control (100 usec feedback loop times)

### Why Bonsai?

ONIX is built on [standard](https://open-ephys.github.io/ONI/) that is software
agnostic. Bonsai is the first software target pursued by the Open Ephys team for
ONIX hardware. There are three major reasons for this:

1. **Performance.** ONIX is a universal interface for neural recording instruments. It
can
   capture data produced by neural probes, cameras, high-speed ADCs, etc. In
   general terms, ONIX can capture data from arbitrary mixtures of
   asynchronous[^1] data sources. Bonsai provides an extremely powerful,
   open-source software platform for elegantly collecting, combining, and
   processing data from essentially any data source regardless of its  sample
   rate, sample regularity, packet size, and bandwidth. Bonsai accomplishes this
   task in a fundamental manner: it explicitly models each data source as an
   ordered temporal sequence with a start and end called an
   [Observable](https://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html). This is
   analogous to how, for instance,
   [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) explicitly models fixed-size
   multi-dimensional arrays as
   [ndarrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray).
   And, just like Numpy offers an extensive linear algebra toolkit
   to operate on these arrays, Bonsai offers an analogous
   [toolkit](https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)
   for operating on temporal sequences of data. Because Bonsai was created around this core
   data model and operator library, capturing, processing and combining data
   sequences from different hardware sources is natural in Bonsai, whereas it is
   bug prone and difficult in other software options.
1. **Code quality.** Open Ephys has been developing open source hardware and
   software for the Neuroscience community for over a decade. In terms of code
   quality, Bonsai is excellent. Bonsai uses a modern language and build system,
   has integrated package management, and an extremely clean, featureful, and well
   maintained API. Given that Bonsai's development model perfectly aligns with our
   values, we are very proud to be able to contribute to its growth in the
   Neuroscience community.
1. **Third party integration.** Bonsai provides support for
   hundreds of pieces of open- and closed-source hardware and software that are
   used extensively in neuroscience research. For instance:

    - The classic Open Ephys [acquisition system](https://open-ephys.org/acquisition-system)
    - [Ucla Miniscope ecosystem](https://open-ephys.github.io/miniscope-docs/index.html)
    - [National Instruments](https://bonsai-rx.org/daqmx/articles/intro.html) acquisition boards
    - Virtually every machine-vision and sCMOS camera[^2]
    - [Sanworks Bpod](https://sanworks.github.io/Bpod_Wiki/)
    - [Harp](https://harp-tech.org/index.html)
    - [Deeplabcut](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/deeplabcut) & [Sleap](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/sleap)
    - And much more

   By targeting Bonsai, ONIX can be used seamlessly with these third party tools.

[^1]: Although physical data sources are asynchronous (e.g. a Neuropixels probe
runs on a distinct clock and produces data at a distinct rate compared to the
camera sensor on a Miniscope), all data is hardware-timestamped on a common
clock. No post-hoc data alignment is required.
