`OpenEphys.Onix1` is a library that can be used in [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) to acquire data from ONIX devices, such as the [ONIX PCIe Acquisition System](https://open-ephys.org/onix/oeps-9006). For more details on the ONI specification, check out [this link](https://open-ephys.github.io/ONI/), and to learn more about ONIX devices and their implementation of ONI, click [here](https://open-ephys.github.io/onix-docs/).

## Advantages

While data can be acquired using programs other than Bonsai, there are a number of advantages that come from building `OpenEphys.Onix1` as a Bonsai library. A major advantage is that it maintains maximal compatibility with open source programs, including [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut), and many more.

Other major advantages include:
* Visual interface provided by building on top of Bonsai's foundation
* Time-stamped synchronization across multiple devices
* Combine data streams for real-time processing
