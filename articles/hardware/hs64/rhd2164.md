The following excerpt from the Headstage64 [example workflow](xref:hs64_hs64) demonstrates the Rhd2164 functionality by streaming and saving data from the Rhd2164 device.

The <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhd2164Data> operator generates a sequence of <xref:OpenEphys.Onix1.Rhd2164DataFrame>s using the following settings:
- `BufferSize` is set to 30. Each `Rhd2164DataFrame` will contain a [1 x 30 sample] `Clock` vector, a [64 channel x 30 sample] `AmplifierData` matrix, and a [3 channel x 30 sample] `AuxData` matrix. This corresponds to 1.2 ms of data per data frame.
- The `Headstage64Data`'s `DeviceName` property is set to "Headstage64/Rhd2164". This links the `Rhd2164Data` operator to the corresponding configuration operator.

The relevant properties are extracted from the `Rhd2164DataFrame` by right-clicking the `Rhd2164Data` operator, and choosing the following **Output** members: `Clock`, `AmplifierData`, and `AuxData`. The [`MatrixWriter`](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/api/Bonsai.Dsp.MatrixWriter.html) operators saves the selected members to files with the following format: `rhd2164-clock_<timestamp>.raw`, `rhd2164-amplifier_<timestamp>.raw`, and `rhd2164-aux_<timestamp>.raw`, respectively.
