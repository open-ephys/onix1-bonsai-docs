title: Breakout Board Example Workflow
---

In the following example workflow, we will explore all of the breakout board's
functionality. The workflow below can by copy/pasted into the Bonsai editor
using the clipboard icon in the top right. This workflow:

- Captures data from the analog and digital inputs on the breakout board and streams them to disk.
- Generates signals to drive the breakout boards analog and digital outputs.
- Receives synchronization messages from the integrated [Harp](https://harp-tech.org/) input
- Controls the clock output for driving synchronizing external hardware with data acquisition
- Monitors and saves hardware memory buffer use information.
- Monitors the breakout board's heartbeat signal.
