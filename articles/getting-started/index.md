Welcome to the user guide! The next few pages are dedicated to users who are unfamiliar with ONIX
and Bonsai, and will teach them what ONIX is, how to download and install Bonsai, open a new file,
place operators (and understand what an operator is), reorder a workflow, run a workflow, and
finally visualize data.

For those who are already familiar with Bonsai and Onix and are looking for a particular device or headstage
to learn about and how to utilize, visit the <xref:hardware>.
