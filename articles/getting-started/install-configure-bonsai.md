## Install Bonsai
To download Bonsai, select between the portable download and the installer download [here](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/installation.html).

*   The **Portable** download (.zip) installs a sandboxed version of Bonsai. Portable environments enable users to switch between different environments to prevent package conflicts or confusion between similar packages.
    *   To install from the **Portable** download, extract the downloaded file. You can start the portable Bonsai by running the `Bonsai.exe` that is inside the extracted folder.
*   The **Installer** download (.exe) installs Bonsai and all its dependencies globally.
    *   To install from the **Installer** download, run the downloaded `Bonsai-X.X.X.exe` file and agree to the involved licenses. You can start the globally installed Bonsai by launching it from the `Bonsai Setup` window after installing or searching for it in your OS's search function, for example. 

> [!TIP]
> When using multiple environments, create and name shortcuts such that different Bonsai environments are easier to find and distinguish.
